# ComputerVision-Projects
I intend in this repository to present different methods to solve computer vision problems.

## rapport_RSNA.pdf
is a document where all steps needed to solve a computer vision problems are detailed. To this end, RSNA competition available in Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge) is choosen. 
First, I analyze the data available and present feature engineering process. Then, the theory around Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is detailed. 
The steps related, among others, to convolution, pooling, padding, dropout as well as data augmentation are outlined.  
Different architectures of CNN  such as VGG (VGG16, VGG19), DenseNet, CheXNet are recalled. Some of these architectures had been implemented and analyzed. 
The Python code used is mentioned for each steps.
